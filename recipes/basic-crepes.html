    <h2>crepes</h2>
    
    <p>crepe, also spelled crêpe, French pancake made of a thin 
        batter containing flour, eggs, melted butter, salt, 
        milk, water, and, if the crepes are to be served with 
        a sweet sauce or garnish, sugar. Crepes can be filled 
        with a variety of sweet or savoury mixtures. For crepes 
        suzette the crepes are folded in four and soaked in a 
        syrup flavoured with orange liqueur, 
        and frequently are flamed at table.</p>
